# Project Background / Client requirements:

## Background:
 - Our client has launched a pop-up caf√© in a busy business district. 
 - They are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding offices. 
 - As such, they require a software application to log and track orders.


## How did you meet the client brief?:
###### (UNDERSTANDING CLIENT SPECIFICATION/REQUIREMENTS)

 - They want to maintain a collection of products and couriers.
 - When a customer makes a new order, We need to create this on the system.
 - We need to be able to update the status of an order [preparing, out-for-delivery, delivered].
 - When We exit my app, We need all data to be persisted and not lost.
 - When We start my app, We need to load all persisted data.
 - We need to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.
 - We Need to regularly update the app with updates
